		<h3>About me</h3>
		<p>Hi, my name is AJ Carothers. I am a Freshman at Eastern Washington University, currently majoring in mechanical engineering however I am highly considering switching to computer programming. I live in Spokane Valley, WA, and attend EWU full time. I have lived in Spokane Valley for 3 years, Sierra Vista Arizona for 9, and Nine Mile Falls for 10 years. My goals consist of, in order, deciding firmly on a major for college, graduating with a Master's in that major as a minimum, and finding a career in my future major.</p>
